## Introduction：
This is a front-end project that took half a week to complete. It utilizes the Vue 3 framework with Vuetify as the UI support and interacts with the Google Maps API to implement various functionalities. <br>
Two sets of layout designs were created for the desktop and mobile interfaces.<br>

The implemented features include:<br>
* Searching for a location by name.<br>
* Obtaining the user's current location from the browser as a search option.<br>
* Displaying images, address, and local time of the searched location, and marking it on the map.<br>
* Recording search history in a list format and displaying it in a paginated manner.<br>
* Allowing users to delete any selected historical locations and removing their records and markers from the map.<br>
